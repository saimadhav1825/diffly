## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All features tested locally
- [ ] Environment variables configured (if any)
- [ ] Build process successful (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile
- [ ] Dark/light mode working
- [ ] All diff types functional

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Currently, no environment variables are required. The application works entirely client-side for diff operations.

## 📊 Performance Optimization

The application is already optimized with:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Turbopack for fast development
- Optimized bundle splitting
- Lazy loading of Monaco Editor
- Efficient diff algorithms

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- File uploads are processed client-side only
- No server-side file storage
- All diff operations happen in the browser
- No sensitive data is transmitted

## 📱 Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## 🎯 Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in production mode.
